                    I am a software developer, creative
                    designer, computer science student graduating with my computer science degree Dec. 2017. I thrive in environments where I'm building something that makes an impact somehow in the world. I am an artist at heart, so I solve problems and work on
                    projects with both my creativity and logical
                    mindset. If you're looking for help on a project, I'd love to get in touch!<br><br>
